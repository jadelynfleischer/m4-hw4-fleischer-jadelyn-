    <h2>Controversy</h2>
        <p>
            On March 10, 2003, the Dixie Chicks performed at the Shepherd's Bush Empire theater in London, England, and Maines told the audience that the band did not support the imminent Allied invasion of Iraq and were "ashamed" that President George W. Bush was from Texas. After this remark, the Dixie Chicks were blacklisted by thousands of country radio stations and several band members even received death threats.
            In October 2004, the Dixie Chicks joined the Vote for Change tour, performing in concerts and raised money for political groups opposing Bush. In 2005, Maguire, Strayer, and Maines joined with 31 other recording artists supporting relationships of all kinds, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, on a two-disc release titled Love Rocks, with their song from the album Home called "I Believe in Love".
